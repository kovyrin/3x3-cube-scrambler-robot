#Rubik's Cube Solver Robot

The software shared here is used to control a robot that will automatically
solve a scrambled Rubik's cube.

The hardware was built using an existing design available on thingiverse.

The main software was written by me and it uses a few libraries that can
be freely downloaded.

The **README_HW.md** file provides additional information about building the
hardware.

The **README_SW.md** file provides additional information about installing,
configuring and running the software.

A video of the robot in action can be found at:
